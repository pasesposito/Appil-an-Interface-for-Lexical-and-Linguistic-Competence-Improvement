				<h1>Lesson 4: The Verb "To Have"</h1>
				<p>Welcome to the fourth lesson! In this lesson, we will focus
					on the verb "to have" in the present tense. This verb is crucial

					opportunities for independent application. We will use a variety of
					contextualized examples and engaging activities, including games
					and interactive exercises, to help you master the verb "to have" in
					a fun and natural way.</p>

			<!-- Section 3: Understanding the Verb "To Have" -->
			<div class="text-container" id="section3">
				<h1>Understanding the Verb "To Have"</h1>
				<p>The verb "to have" is one of the most versatile and
					frequently used verbs in English. It is essential for indicating
					possession (e.g., "I have a car"), describing relationships (e.g.,
					"She has a brother"), and discussing experiences (e.g., "They have
					been to Paris"). In the present tense, "to have" appears in two
					forms:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>"Have":</strong> Used with the subjects I, you,
						we, they.
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Example:</strong> "I have a meeting tomorrow."</li>
							<li><strong>Example:</strong> "They have a new house."</li>
						</ul></li>
					<li><strong>"Has":</strong> Used with the subjects he, she,
						it.
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Example:</strong> "She has a beautiful voice."</li>
							<li><strong>Example:</strong> "It has a unique design."</li>
						</ul></li>
				</ul>
				<p>Let’s break down its use in different sentence structures:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Affirmative Sentences:</strong> These sentences
						state something that is true.
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Example:</strong> "I have a book." / "She has a
								beautiful voice."</li>
						</ul></li>
					<li><strong>Negative Sentences:</strong> These sentences
						express something that is not true. We use "do not" (don’t) or
						"does not" (doesn’t) to form negatives.
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Example:</strong> "They do not (don’t) have any
								pets." / "He does not (doesn’t) have a car."</li>
						</ul></li>
					<li><strong>Interrogative Sentences:</strong> These sentences
						ask a question. We use "do" or "does" to begin the question.
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Example:</strong> "Do you have any questions?" /
								"Does she have a guitar?"</li>
						</ul></li>
				</ul>
				<p>Understanding these forms and how they are used in different
					types of sentences will help you communicate more effectively in
					English. Now, let's practice using "to have" with some interactive
					exercises.</p>
			</div>

			<!-- Section 4: Interactive Cloze Exercise -->
			<div class="text-container" id="section4">
				<h1>Interactive Cloze Exercise</h1>
				<p>Now that you understand the basics of the verb "to have,"
					it’s time to practice! In this exercise, you will complete
					sentences by filling in the blanks with the correct form of "to
					have" (either "have" or "has"). This will help you reinforce your
					understanding of how the verb is used in context.</p>

				<h3>Cloze Exercise: The Verb "To Have"</h3>
				<p>Fill in the blanks with the correct form of the verb "to
					have" (have/has):</p>

				<form id="clozeForm">
					<div class="cloze-row">
						<span>1. They</span> <input type="text" class="cloze-input"
							id="input1"> <span>a new puppy.</span>

						<span>2. She</span> <input type="text" class="cloze-input"
							id="input2"> <span>many friends at school.</span>
					</div>
					<div class="cloze-row">
						<span>3. Do you</span> <input type="text" class="cloze-input"
							id="input3"> <span>any free time this weekend?</span>
					</div>
					<div class="cloze-row">
						<span>4. He</span> <input type="text" class="cloze-input"

					</div>
					<button type="button" onclick="checkAnswers()">Check
						Answers</button>
				</form>


				<div id="feedback"></div>

				<script>
					function checkClozeAnswers() {
						// Correct answers
						const answers = [ "have", "has", "have", "has", "have" ];

						// Getting the user inputs
						let userAnswers = [];
						for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
							userAnswers.push(document.getElementById('input'
									+ i).value.trim().toLowerCase());
						}

						// Checking the answers and providing feedback
						let feedback = "";
						for (let i = 0; i < answers.length; i++) {
							const inputElement = document
									.getElementById('input' + (i + 1));
							if (userAnswers[i] === answers[i]) {
								feedback += `Sentence ${i + 1}: <span class="correct">Correct</span><br>`;
								inputElement.style.backgroundColor = "lightgreen";
							} else {
								feedback += `Sentence ${i + 1}: <span class="incorrect">Incorrect</span> (Correct answer: "${answers[i]}")<br>`;
								inputElement.style.backgroundColor = "lightcoral";
							}
						}

						// Display feedback
						document.getElementById('feedback').innerHTML = feedback;
					}
				</script>

			<!-- Section 5: Interactive Flashcards -->
			<div class="text-container" id="section5">
				<h1>Interactive Flashcards</h1>
				<p>Now that you’ve practiced using "to have" in sentences, let’s
					reinforce your learning with a fun matching activity. You will use
					flashcards to match subjects with the correct form of the verb "to
					have" and related vocabulary. This will help you solidify your
					understanding of how "to have" is used with different subjects.</p>
				<p>Instructions: Look at each flashcard and try to match the
					subject (e.g., "He") with the correct verb form (e.g., "Has") and a
					relevant vocabulary term (e.g., "A piano"). Try to complete the
					matches mentally before checking your answers.</p>

			<!-- Section 6: Game - "Guess Who?" 
			<div class="text-container" id="section6">
				<h1>Game: "Guess Who?"</h1>
				<p>In this fun and interactive game, you'll describe someone
					using sentences with the verb "to have," and your partner will try
					to guess who you're describing. This is an excellent way to
					practice using "to have" in a social context, while also developing
					your descriptive language skills.</p>
				<p>Here’s how to play:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Think of a person you know (a friend, family member, or
						even a celebrity).</li>
					<li>Describe them using sentences with "to have." For example,
						"She has long brown hair and a friendly smile."</li>
					<li>Your partner will listen to your description and try to
						guess who you’re talking about.</li>
					<li>Take turns with your partner, giving descriptions and
						making guesses.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Try to use as many descriptive phrases as you can. This game
					not only helps with your verb usage but also encourages creative
					thinking and improves your ability to describe people accurately.</p>
			</div>

			 Section 7: Game - Game of the Goose -->
			 
			<div class="text-container" id="section6">
				<h1>Game: Game of the Goose</h1>
				<p>Get ready for an exciting board game that tests your
					knowledge of the verb "to have"! The Game of the Goose is a classic
					game where you move around the board by rolling dice, but with a
					twist—each space has a question or sentence to complete using the
					correct form of "to have." It’s a great way to practice while
					having fun.</p>
				<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Roll the dice and move your piece the corresponding number
						of spaces on the board.</li>
					<li>When you land on a space, you’ll see a sentence with a
						blank. Your task is to fill in the blank with the correct form of
						"to have."</li>
					<li>If you answer correctly, you stay on that space. If not,
						you move back one space.</li>
					<li>The first player to reach the end of the board wins!</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<strong>Example:</strong> You land on a space with the sentence
					"They ____ three cats." Your answer should be "have." If correct,
					you remain on that space and wait for your next turn.
				</p>
				<p>This game is a fun way to reinforce what you’ve learned about
					"to have," as well as to improve your quick thinking and
					decision-making skills.</p>
